# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
I have a pretty understanding of the comparion operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Same as the first question. I sometimes get slipped up but can find myself after a second.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
This one is a little harder.  I know what to do but sometimes I blank and need a second to right my brain.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I have spent over an hour doing these plus in class time.  I thought I could do it faster but navagating and reading the directions correctly slowed me down plus looking up a few things to make sure everything was correct.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Knowing all the commands.  I need to look up formating and the correct commands and that slows me down.  I have been thinking about making a cheat sheet for quick reference to save time and I can study it.  I need to do it after my work is done and add that to the calendar for post assignment time.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have formatting questions and command questions.  I plan on using the study hall and teammates for help.
